### General Information

The setup for the database is presented in the image titled "Database Setup (ER Diagram)"

Besides that, I have included the scripts (SQL Code) to make these tables, as well as insert sample data into them.

The "Output With Sample Data" pdf shows example images of the output when you run the provided scripts.  


#### Please note the following:
- The code was written in a MySQL Environment.

- The use of a stored procedure means the code is not compatible with online MySQL editors. Something like phpMyAdmin, which can store procedures, is effective.

- The stored procedure is my solution to ensuring that resources must have at least one tag, rather than that being built into the database design.
